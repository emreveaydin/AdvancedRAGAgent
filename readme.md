## 🚦 Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/username/advanced-rag-system.git

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env

# Run the application
python main.py
```

## 🏗 System Architecture

The system consists of three main components:

1. **Data Processing Layer**
   - Vector database management
   - Document processing and chunking
   - Web search integration

2. **RAG Processing Engine**
   - Question routing
   - Document evaluation
   - Response generation

3. **Validation Layer**
   - Hallucination checking
   - Response quality assessment
   - Accuracy verification

## ⚙️ Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9+
- Qdrant database
- OpenAI API key
- Tavily API key

### Configuration
Set the following variables in your `.env` file:
```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
TAVILY_API_KEY=your_key_here
QDRANT_HOST=localhost
QDRANT_PORT=6333
```

## 🎮 Usage

```python
from rag_system import RAGSystem

# Initialize the system
rag = RAGSystem()

# Ask a question
response = rag.ask("What is the current state of AI technology?")

# Get the response
print(response.answer)
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

The system can be customized through the `config.yaml` file:

```yaml
model:
  name: gpt-4
  temperature: 0
retrieval:
  chunk_size: 250
  overlap: 0
grading:
  threshold: 0.7
```

## 📚 API Reference

### RAGSystem
```python
def ask(question: str) -> Response:
    """Main question-answering method"""

def grade_documents(docs: List[Document]) -> List[Document]:
    """Document evaluation"""

def check_hallucination(response: str) -> bool:
    """Hallucination checking"""
```
